## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to explore and develop advanced numerical representation learning methods, applied to financial time series and graph-structured data, to extract stable and interpretable alpha signals. The ultimate goal is to significantly outperform traditional quantitative benchmarks by leveraging deep mathematical analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

The research will focus on understanding how disentangled numerical representations capture distinct market dynamics, how self-supervised learning can generalize robust features across diverse market conditions, and the impact of complex mathematical relationships on signal stability and profitability. Advanced numerical optimization techniques will be integrated for superior risk-adjusted portfolio construction.
