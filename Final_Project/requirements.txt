# PyTorch and TensorFlow Installation:

# torch and tensorflow are listed, but their installation often depends on your hardware (CPU-only vs. GPU with CUDA).
# For GPU (CUDA) support: You typically need to install them with specific commands from their official websites, which include the CUDA version. For example:
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (for PyTorch with CUDA 11.8)
# pip install tensorflow[and-cuda] (for TensorFlow with CUDA)
# For CPU-only: pip install torch and pip install tensorflow usually suffice.
# Recommendation: It's often best to install these two manually first according to your system's GPU setup, and then install the rest of the requirements.txt. If you put them directly in requirements.txt, pip will install the CPU-only versions by default unless you specify otherwise.
# torch-geometric: This library depends on torch. Ensure torch is installed correctly before or alongside torch-geometric.
# igraph vs. python-igraph: The Python package for igraph is typically installed via pip install python-igraph.
